Prompt #1: maximum declarations score with 4 cards in hand
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm playing cards with a friend (one-on-one). Based on the game rules, which I'll write below, can you help me understand what is the maximum score for declarations ("accuse") I can make in a single game?

Game rules:

- A standard deck of Italian cards is used, which is a 40-card deck with 4 different suits.
- One of the two players deals 4 cards to each player, leaving the remaining deck face down on the table.
- The game consists of tricks. In each trick, the player who plays first is the player who took the previous trick. For the first trick, the player who plays first is the player who didn't deal the cards. Each player plays a card from their hand and places it on the table. The player who plays second must play a card of the same suit as the suit of the first card played in that trick. If they don't have any cards from that suit, they are free to play any other card but cannot win the trick. The trick is taken by the player who played the highest-ranking card of the suit of the first card played in that trick. The player who takes the trick places the two cards played in the trick and places them in their own pile of cards, which will be used to count the points at the end of the game. If there are cards left in the deck, the player who takes the trick draws the top card from the deck and adds it to their hand; the other player does the same right after. As previously mentioned, the player who took the trick leads the next trick, and so on until the cards in hand are depleted. 
- For the purpose of awarding the trick, each card is assigned a rank determined by its position in the following scale (ordered from highest to lowest rank): Three, Two, Ace, King, Knight (Cavallo), Jack (Fante), Seven, Six, Five, Four. The trick is awarded to the player who plays the highest-ranking card of the suit led by the first player of that trick.
- For calculating the score at the end of a single game, each card is assigned a numerical value according to the following scheme: The Ace is worth 1 point; face cards (Jack, Knight, King) and other high-value cards (Two, Three) are worth 1/3 of a point; the remaining cards have no value. To avoid non-integer scores, fractional parts are eliminated from the final calculation (e.g., 5 points and 2/3 becomes 5 points), and an additional point is awarded to the player who took the last trick.
- Additionally, there is a mechanism called declaration ("accusa") that allows players to score additional points if they hold a particular combination of cards in their hand. The combination called "bongioco" involves holding three or four cards of the same rank, limited to Aces, Twos, or Threes. A player can score points for a Bongioco in the following two ways. First, by declaring three cards of a rank (e.g., three Aces), which scores 3 points. A player can only score these 3 points once per rank during the entire game. Second, by declaring four cards of a rank (e.g., four Aces), which scores 4 points. A player can only score these 4 points once per rank during the entire game. The maximum Bongioco score for any single rank is 7 points: for example, if a player declares three Aces (scoring 3 points), and in a subsequent turn acquires the fourth Ace while still holding the other three, they can then declare four Aces, scoring an additional 4 points for that rank. Alternatively, the combination called "cricca" is the combination of an Ace, Two, and Three of the same suit. It is worth 3 points. At the beginning of a trick, after cards have been drawn (if applicable) but before the leading player plays their card, players may make any valid declarations, and if you have multiple combinations in hand then you can make multiple declarations, as long as the previous rules are respected.
